# PROGRAM 1A

Write a program to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a series of *n* real numbers.

# PROGRAM 2A

Write a program to count the logical lines in a program, omitting comments and blank lines. Use the counting standard produced by report exercise R1 to place one logical line on each physical line and count physical lines. Produce a single count for the entire program source file.

# PROGRAM 5A

Write a program to numerically integrate a function using Simpsonâ€™s rule and write the function for the normal distribution. The program should be designed to integrate using various supplied functions. This rule and several example calculations are given in Section A5. You will need this program to calculate the values of the various statistical distributions used in later program assignments and in the analysis of your PSP data. This program is used in several subsequent exercises where programs are used to calculate values of the normal distribution, the t distribution, and the x2 distribution.
